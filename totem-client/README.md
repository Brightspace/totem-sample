# Totem Client

Totem Client helps Totem deploy your application.  It works with Totem during the **BuildSource** action to incorporate your application's template into a general blue-green deployment template.  Totem then uses the blue-green template to drive deployment, updating its blue-green stack during the **PreDeploy**, **Deploy**, and **PostDeploy** actions. To install Totem Client, commit a copy of the library into your application's GitHub repository.
